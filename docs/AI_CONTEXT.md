# AI_CONTEXT — WaterBuddy

Orientation for anyone (human or model) picking this repo up cold.
Authority order is unchanged: **DocC on the type you are changing** → `.claude/rules/` →
`CLAUDE.md` → this file. This document records *where the work stands*, never what the rules say.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01 (twenty-second pass — cascade after **the process role model** landed
2026-08-31 23:34 with no checkpoint and no doc sync. `isAppExtension` is no longer a guard anywhere:
all six sites read `DataManager.role`, a four-state `nonisolated static let`, and a new *The process
role* section documents it. The `@Test` count re-derived at **259** across **23** suites — the
twenty-third is `ProcessRoleTests`. The gate was re-run in full this session. **Two known issues
retired on evidence:** #8 (shared schemes now exist on disk) and #9 (the documented destination
resolves again — re-probed by running a test, per rule `85-testing`). **One known issue corrected
rather than retired:** #10's closing claim about `theTripwireHelperEnumeratesEveryStoredKey` was
itself false. Three new issues added: two rule files now mandate a guard the code no longer has
(#15), three DocC comments went stale and the fix was declined (#16), and the role model's
compile-time half is unbuilt (#17). Previously: twenty-first pass — cascade after the six test fixtures that reached a real `UNUserNotificationCenter` were closed; known issue #6 retired, the `@Test` count re-derived at **252**, the suite table and the file block updated, the gate re-run in full this session. The known issue's own denominator was two changes stale — it said eight `DataManager(` sites, the tree has eleven — and that is recorded in `tasks/lessons.md`. Previously: twentieth pass — `/doc_sync` verification after the vessels landed; the file block, counts, keys and roster re-derived and already current, one stale code sample in `docs/WIDGET.md` corrected, the Settings cards' contrast measured for the first time. Previously: editable quick-add vessels, an eighth key, and the midnight-entry language bug; the file block, both catalogue counts, the gate, the suite table and the targets table re-derived; the Git section rewritten from `git rev-parse`, which reports no repository; five known issues added)

## What this is

An iPhone hydration tracker on the arc *log → see → log again without opening the app*.
No account and no server.

**Storage is now two stores in one App Group, and the split is the whole design:**

| Store | Holds | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| SwiftData — `WaterBuddy.store` | every ``WaterLog`` (`id`, `amount`, `timestamp`) — the **source of truth** | the app only |
| `UserDefaults` — eight keys | today's total, goal, day ordinal, three flags, the chosen language, the three quick-add amounts — a **derived cache** | the app *and* the widget |

Today's total is not stored; it is the sum of today's logs, recomputed after every mutation and
written through to the cache. **The widget never opens SwiftData.** A `TimelineProvider` carries no
isolation and a `ModelContext` is not `Sendable`, so reading through the cache is what keeps
`HydrationProvider` synchronous and `nonisolated` (rule `43-concurrency`). The cache is never
authoritative — it cannot drift without the log side being wrong first.

`DataManager` remains the only writer to either store.

Two front doors, and one serving they must agree on. The app's quick-add row offers three
vessels — Cup 150 ml, **Glass 250 ml**, Bottle 500 ml — and the widget's `AddWaterIntent` offers
one. The middle vessel is whatever the user set it to (`250` ml by default), read from the suite rather
than as a literal, because the widget's face says `+250 ml` and the two must not drift. The other
two amounts are an app-only menu on `HomeView`, in the same sense as `HistoryView.servingRange`.

## Targets

| Target | Bundle id | Sources | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WaterBuddy` | `sardor.WaterBuddy` | `WaterBuddy/` | **LIVE** — SwiftUI, `@Observable` `DataManager` over SwiftData |
| `WaterBuddyWidgetExtension` | `sardor.WaterBuddy.WaterBuddyWidget` | `WaterBuddyWidget/` **+ 6 shared files** | **LIVE** — `StaticConfiguration`, interactive `AddWaterIntent` |
| `WaterBuddyTests` | `sardor.WaterBuddyTests` | `WaterBuddyTests/` | **LIVE** — swift-testing, 259 `@Test` functions in 23 suites |
| `WaterBuddyUITests` | `sardor.WaterBuddyUITests` | `WaterBuddyUITests/` | **LIVE** — `GoalSetupUITests` (7 real tests) plus the Xcode template's 3. 10 declared, **15 executed** — `testLaunch` runs once per launch configuration |

Every target's sources come from a `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, so a new `.swift` file
dropped in a folder joins that target with no project edit.

### The six shared files

Verified against `project.pbxproj` → `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedBuildFileExceptionSet`
(target `WaterBuddyWidgetExtension`):

```
DataManager.swift
LiquidGlassModifier.swift
NotificationManager.swift
ReminderPlan.swift
WaterLog.swift
WaterSurface.swift
```

`ReminderPlan.swift` and `NotificationManager.swift` joined because `AddWaterIntent` reschedules
reminders **from the extension**, and `perform()` is the only place that work can be awaited.

`WaterLog.swift` joined the list with the SwiftData move: `DataManager` is shared and references
the model, and `AddWaterIntent` runs **in the extension**, so the widget process genuinely inserts
rows. Both processes open the same store file in the App Group container.

They live in `WaterBuddy/` and compile into **both** targets. Everything else under `WaterBuddy/`
— `RootTabView.swift`, `HomeView.swift`, `WaterBuddyApp.swift`, `GoalSetupView.swift`,
`HistoryView.swift`, `SettingsView.swift`, `AuroraBackground.swift`, `PressStyle.swift` — is
app-only. Editing one of the
six edits two processes; adding a seventh means editing that list.

```

`AuroraBackground` and `PressStyle` were `private` inside `HomeView.swift` until `GoalSetupView`
became a second consumer. They are **app-only**: the widget re-expresses the same lights itself in
`WidgetAurora`, because the app's absolute ±240pt offsets mean nothing on a 158pt canvas. Only the
colours in `Aurora` are shared between the two processes.

Plus `Entitlements/WaterBuddy.entitlements`, `Entitlements/WaterBuddyWidgetExtension.entitlements`
(both declaring `group.sardor.WaterBuddy`) and `WaterBuddyWidget-Info.plist`
(`NSExtensionPointIdentifier = com.apple.widgetkit-extension` only).

And four non-Swift build inputs, plus one file that is deliberately *not* one:

| | |
|---|---|
| `WaterBuddy/Localizable.xcstrings` | **58** keys — 54 translated into en/ru/uz, 4 deliberately not (`%`, `+%lld`, `1,450 ml`, `WaterBuddy`). The explicit `en` values are what make the build emit an `en.lproj` to select |
| `WaterBuddyWidget/Localizable.xcstrings` | **19** keys — 10 hand-written as a strict subset of the app's (a membership exception cannot carry a resource), plus **9 the build extracted**, all untranslated. Five of those nine are `AddWaterIntent`'s Shortcuts vocabulary — known issue #1 |
| `WaterBuddy/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-{light,dark,tinted}.png` | 1024², generated |
| `Tools/GenerateAppIcon.swift` | **not in any target.** `Tools/` is not a synchronized root, which is the point — a `.swift` file in `WaterBuddy/` would join the app, and this one imports AppKit |

## Non-negotiables

These are the ones that a passing test suite cannot protect. Full reasoning lives in the DocC and
in `.claude/rules/`.

1. **`DataManager` is the only writer**, to *either* store. Views, intents and providers never
   touch `UserDefaults` or a `ModelContext`.
2. **`addWater` / `removeWater` call `refresh()` first.** Two processes hold their own instance;
   a stale one would write `staleTotal + amount` over a newer figure.
3. **The widget reads through `WaterSnapshot`, never `DataManager.shared`.** Constructing a
   `DataManager` is four writes from a process whose job is to draw.
4. **Reset writes the zero *before* it stamps the day.** The opposite order launders yesterday's
   water into today. Since the log became the source of truth this only clears the **cache** —
   yesterday's rows stay as history, and `resetDailyProgress()` is the one path that deletes rows.
5. **The day is a `yyyyMMdd` ordinal, never a `Date`.** An instant is re-read under the current
   time zone and travel would wipe a day.
6. **The container URL is the App Group probe** — `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` returns a live object
   even when the entitlement is missing.
7. **Only the app writes on behalf of the group** — the goal materialisation, the day stamp and
   the one-shot migration are all guarded by `DataManager.role`, which as of 2026-08-31 replaced
   the two-state `isAppExtension` at every guard site. See *The process role* below.
8. **`isGoalSet` is never materialised.** Its absence carries meaning.
9. **No `Material` in the widget** — `LiquidGlass.Base.archived` is the measured stand-in.
10. **Today's total is derived, never authored.** It is the sum of today's logs, written through
    the `currentWater` setter so the clamp, the equality guard and the widget doorbell all still
    fire exactly once.
11. **A failed read must not write.** `recomputeToday()` leaves the total untouched when the store
    cannot be read; returning `[]` on error once turned a transient failure into permanent loss.
12. **Every test builds an in-memory `ModelContainer`.** Omitting it resolves the *real* App Group
    store — see `tasks/lessons.md`.
13. **Reminders decide nothing at delivery time.** There is no fire-time hook for a local
    notification, so "skip this one" is an absence, not a filter — `ReminderPlan` is a pure value
    computed in advance. `removeAllPendingNotificationRequests()` is never called: from the
    extension it would clear the *app's* entire set (rule `80-notifications`).
14. **A read path may re-publish, but must not write back.** `refresh()` republishes
    `todaysLogs` and deliberately does *not* recompute the total from them: a cross-process
    SwiftData fetch can succeed while returning stale rows, and re-deriving would overwrite the
    widget's serving. See `tasks/lessons.md`.
15. **Nothing from `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md` is a build input.** All four
    `PBXResourcesBuildPhase` sections are currently empty — verified this run.
16. **A type `DataManager` exposes lives *inside* `DataManager.swift`.** `WaterSnapshot`,
    `AppLanguage` and now `DaySummary` are declared at file scope in that one file rather than in
    files of their own. `DataManager.swift` is one of the six compiled into the widget extension,
    so a type it references from a separate app-only file is a break that appears **only** in the
    widget build — which the app scheme's green run never touches (rule `15-project`).
17. **History never reaches the widget.** `republishHistory()` opens with
    `guard Self.role.drawsHistory`, because `recomputeToday()` deliberately carries no such guard and
    `AddWaterIntent` therefore reaches `saveAndRecompute()` on every widget tap. Without it, that
    tap would run a seven-day fetch and a full Swift-side roll-up inside a process whose entire job
    is to draw one number. A per-day series is derivable from none of the eight cache keys, so
    there is nothing for `WaterSnapshot` to carry (rule `40-widget`).
18. **A past day is judged against the *current* goal, and the screen says so.** `Key.dailyGoal` is
    one scalar overwritten in place and `WaterLog` carries no goal, so nothing in either store can
    say what the goal *was* on a past day. `DaySummary` therefore has **no `goal` field** — one
    would be today's figure stamped onto every bar while looking like a record, and the next reader
    would believe it. The limitation is disclosed in the card's own copy.
19. **The two front doors agree by a shared read, not a shared constant.** The quick-add vessels are
    editable, and the middle one is what the widget's button logs and its face draws. Both resolve
    `Key.servings` from the App Group suite; `WaterSnapshot.serving` is how it crosses. A constant
    re-introduced on either side is the drift `defaultServing` used to prevent by being the only
    spelling, and `theWidgetsServingIsTheAppsMiddleVessel` asserts the read at an *edited* value so
    a constant would fail it.
20. **`WaterSnapshot.rolledOver()` is how the midnight entry is built, never a memberwise call.**
    Copying `self` and zeroing one field is what makes a forgotten field impossible. Built by
    enumeration, that entry silently reset `language` to `.system` — the widget reverted to the
    device language at local midnight, for two releases, invisibly.
21. **A `nonisolated static` that projects model state takes the state as a parameter.**
    `HomeView.servings(amounts:)` takes `[Int]`, not the `DataManager`. Reaching a `@MainActor`
    property from a `nonisolated` context needs `MainActor.assumeIsolated`, which *traps* when the
    assumption is wrong — a `precondition` in all but name, and this codebase has none.
22. **Which binary this is, is a four-state question — `DataManager.role`, not `isAppExtension`.**
    Landed 2026-08-31. Every `!Self.isAppExtension` guard is gone; a grep returns **zero**.

## The process role

`DataManager.role` (`DataManager.swift:1032`) resolves once, `nonisolated static let`, from
`isAppExtension` plus `#if os(watchOS)` — never a second runtime probe, which rule
`25-shared-storage` forbids because two probes can disagree and leave one guard open.

```
enum Role: Sendable, CaseIterable {   // DataManager.swift:1041
    case phoneApp, phoneExtension, watchApp, watchExtension
}
```

`isAppExtension` was a **two-state answer to a four-state question**, and it answered it wrongly
for a watch: a watchOS app is a `.app`, so `pathExtension == "appex"` is `false` and every
`!isAppExtension` guard would *open* on the wrist. The enum asks four separate questions, each an
exhaustive `switch` with **no `default`**, so a fifth binary fails to compile until somebody
answers all four for it:

| Question | Gates | Sites |
|---|---|---|
| `ownsSharedStorage` | *is this container my own first-class home?* | `:420` goal materialisation, `:760` fresh-install day stamp |
| `mayHaveLegacyStandardDefaults` | *has my `.standard` ever held WaterBuddy state?* | `:691` `seedFromCachedTotalIfNeeded`, `:1175` `migrateIfNeeded` |
| `drawsHistory` | *do I have a history surface to draw?* | `:627` `republishHistory` |
| `mayFileReminders` | *may I file notifications for this user?* | `:847` `requestReminderReschedule` |

Only `.phoneApp` answers `true` to any of them today. The fourth is the one whose wrong answer is
immediately user-visible: `ReminderPlan.Slot.identifier` is a pure function of day and hour, so a
second notification centre filing the same plan cannot dedupe against the first — two buzzes per
slot, or 28 silent `add` failures into a discarded `ReconcileOutcome`.

Pinned by `ProcessRoleTests` (`WaterSnapshotTests.swift:519`): `onlyThePhoneAppOwnsTheGroupsBookkeeping`,
`aWatchAppAnswersLikeAnExtensionAndNotLikeTheApp`, `theTestHostResolvesAsThePhoneApp`,
`everyRoleIsAccountedFor`.

**Two rule files are now wrong about this**, and a doc sync may not fix them — see known issue #15.

## Current state

**Gate — all three run 2026-09-01, from the project directory, one simulator, no parallel cloning.**
Re-run in full this session against the role model that landed 2026-08-31 23:34, which had shipped
with no checkpoint and no cascade.

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `xcodebuild test … -only-testing:WaterBuddyTests -parallel-testing-enabled NO` | `✔ Test run with 259 tests in 23 suites passed` |
| `xcodebuild test … -only-testing:WaterBuddyUITests -parallel-testing-enabled NO` | `** TEST SUCCEEDED **` — `Executed 15 tests, with 0 failures` |
| `xcodebuild build … -scheme WaterBuddyWidgetExtension` | `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`, 0 warnings |

**The documented destination resolves again.** The runs above used
`id=7DA32C6F-CED9-4D5F-A093-75A3199D8E2B`, following the standing advice below — but the documented
spelling was then re-probed the way rule `85-testing` requires (by running a test, not by asking
whether it resolves):

```
xcodebuild test … -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.6,name=iPhone 16' \
  -only-testing:WaterBuddyTests/AppTabTests -parallel-testing-enabled NO
→ ✔ Test run with 6 tests in 1 suite passed
```

`CLAUDE.md` and rule `85-testing` are therefore **correct as written**, and the `id=` workaround is
no longer needed — which matters, because rule `85-testing` explicitly forbids pinning by device id
("resolves nothing on anybody else's machine"). Two iOS runtimes are now installed, 18.6 and 26.5,
so the `OS=18.6` pin is more load-bearing than ever. Known issue #9 retired.

**The UI suite flaked once, and the gate's *order* looks load-bearing.** The first UI run this
session failed `testSettingsIsReachableFromHomeAsATab` with *"Failed to get matching snapshots:
Error getting main window Unknown kAXError value -25218"*. It passed alone, then the full suite
passed 15/15 from a clean `xcrun simctl shutdown all`. The difference was that the failing run had
the widget **build** between the two test invocations rather than last, leaving a booted simulator
the UI suite then tripped over. n=1 on the failure, so this is suspected rather than proven — but
run the gate in the documented order, and shut the simulator down first. Related to known issue #12.

**The test half is two invocations rather than one.** The combined run exceeds the 600s
foreground limit available here, and rule `85-testing` forbids reporting on a run nobody watched
finish. Same destination, same `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`, same set of tests — only split.

- **0 failures** — 259 swift-testing `@Test` functions across 23 suites, plus 10 declared XCTest
  cases in `WaterBuddyUITests` that execute as **15** (`WaterBuddyUITestsLaunchTests.testLaunch`
  runs once per launch configuration). The unit run prints
  `✔ Test run with 259 tests in 23 suites passed`, which only a non-parallel run emits. The seven
  new ones and the twenty-third suite arrived with the role model: `ProcessRoleTests` is the new
  suite, in `WaterSnapshotTests.swift`.
- **One compiler warning, and it is pre-existing.** `DataManagerTests.swift:1102`'s
  `@Test(arguments:)` passes a non-`Sendable` `KeyPath<ClosedRange<Int>, Int>` across an isolation
  boundary — *"this is an error in the Swift 6 language mode"*. It fires on every full compile of
  the test module and predates this pass; rule `43-concurrency` documents the family. Known issue
  #8. The previous edition of this document claimed **0 compiler warnings**, which was wrong.
  **This session saw it on the targeted run and not on the full one** — by then the test module was
  already compiled, so `grep -c warning:` over the full unit log returned 0. That is a cache
  artefact, not a fix: the warning is still there. No new warning was introduced.
  (The `appintentsmetadataprocessor` line reporting no `AppIntents.framework` dependency for the
  `WaterBuddyTests` module is expected and is not a compiler warning: `AddWaterIntent` is compiled
  into the extension only. The log also carries transient `FBSOpenApplicationServiceErrorDomain`
  lines from the UI-test runner being retried; the retry succeeds and every case reports.)

| Suite | Cases | Isolation |
|---|---|---|
| `DataManagerTests` + `DailyGoalSetupTests` + `ReminderSeamTests` + `LanguageSeamTests` | 73 `@Test` | `@MainActor` |
| `DaySummaryTests` | 15 `@Test` | **deliberately not `@MainActor`** — the per-day roll-up is a pure transformation over `[WaterLog]` and a `Calendar`; if it ever reached instance state on `DataManager` this suite would stop compiling |
| `HistoryWindowTests` | 6 `@Test` | `@MainActor` — the published `history` window |
| `LocalizationTests` | 11 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — reads the two built bundles' string tables |
| `ConfettiTests` + `HapticLadderTests` | 10 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — a seeded burst and three numbers |
| `AuroraLightTests` | 6 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — the backdrop's three lights |
| `AppLanguageTests` | 8 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — a provider must be able to read the language |
| `LiquidGlassInteractionTests` | 7 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — the press multipliers and the tint ceiling |
| `WaterLogStoreTests` | 23 `@Test` | `@MainActor` (a `ModelContext` is main-actor bound here) |
| `HistoryServingTests` | 5 `@Test` | `@MainActor` — the serving editor's offered range |
| `HomeServingTests` | 6 `@Test` | `@MainActor` — the quick-add row's offered vessels |
| `AppTabTests` | 6 `@Test` | **not `@MainActor`** — `AppTab` is top-level, so it has no isolation to inherit |
| `NotificationManagerTests` | 10 `@Test` | not `@MainActor` — reconcile runs in an extension |
| `ReminderPlanTests` | 15 `@Test` | **not `@MainActor`, and no `UserNotifications` import** |
| `WaterSnapshotTests` + `WidgetLanguageTests` | 28 `@Test` | **deliberately not `@MainActor`** |
| `GoalSetupUITests` | 6 XCTest | UI, hosted app — orientation pinned in `setUp` |
| template UI tests | 3 XCTest | UI, hosted app |

`WaterSnapshotTests` being non-isolated is load-bearing, and the SwiftData move did **not** cost
us that canary: the snapshot path still reads only `UserDefaults`, so the suite still compiles
without the main actor. If a future change made the widget's read path touch a `ModelContext`,
this suite would stop compiling — which is exactly the warning we want.

**Verified beyond the gate this run:** the **week card** was rendered on the simulator and read
back, because the unit suite injects its own store and clock and so cannot see a screen at all.

A temporary probe (`ZZHistoryProbe` plus a `-ZZSeedHistory` hook, both **deleted before staging** —
`grep -rn 'ZZ'` across all four targets now returns nothing) back-dated six days of servings through
`addLog(amount:at:)`, the product's own writer, then drove the History tab and captured it at the
default text size and at `UICTContentSizeCategoryAccessibilityXXXL`.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| The card draws seven bars, weekdays `M T W T F S S` with today last | yes — today was Sunday 30 August and the rightmost label is `S` |
| The accessibility category actually took hold | the card's frame grew **222.7pt → 478pt**. A silently-ignored category is a real trap here: `…AccessibilityExtraExtraExtraLarge` is *not* a category name and launches at the default size, which `tasks/lessons.md` records as a probe that passed while proving nothing |
| One VoiceOver stop, not fourteen | `app.otherElements.matching(identifier: "Last 7 days").count == 1`, now pinned permanently by `testLoggingAServingRevealsTheWeekCardAsOneElement` |
| Nothing truncates at the largest text size | only after two fixes — see below |

**Two defects that only a render could show**, both introduced by this work and both fixed:

- At `AccessibilityXXXL` the figures line truncated to *"Average 2871 ml · Best…"* and the
  disclosure to *"Measured again…"*. **Different causes.** The first was genuinely too wide for the
  `minimumScaleFactor` floor — a `.footnote` is around 44pt there, and 0.6 of it still overflows the
  pane. The second was **vertical** compression: the card sits above a `List` in a stack with no
  scroller, so `Text` gave up lines rather than pushing back. Fixed with `ViewThatFits` (row becomes
  column) and `fixedSize(horizontal:vertical:)` respectively.
- The disclosure caption at `white.opacity(0.55)` measured **4.06:1** against a 4.5:1 small-text
  floor, and the weekday captions at `0.60` measured **exactly 4.50:1** — the floor itself, with no
  margin under an aurora that moves continuously. Now `0.70` (5.49:1) and `0.72` (5.70:1).

**And one the adversarial review found after that.** A seven-surface rule-compliance review of the
diff, three refuters per candidate, produced **8 candidates and confirmed 0** — but two refutations
were 2-of-3 splits, and in both the dissenter was right:

- The bars were a `Aurora.blue` → `Aurora.cyan` gradient, published in `docs/DESIGN.md` at
  "3.33:1 at the blue end". That figure was sampled off a real rendered bar and was still wrong:
  a short bar's pixels are the *average* of the gradient, not its endpoint. Pure `Aurora.blue`
  composites to **2.72:1**, under the 3:1 non-text floor. The bars are now solid `Aurora.cyan`
  (**5.22:1**).
- `theDailyTotalSaturatesRatherThanTrappingOnACorruptRow` fed `[Int.max, 500]` and never reached the
  overflow branch: `0 + Int.max` does not overflow, so the clamp alone gave the right answer and the
  test passed even with a plain `+`. `aCorruptRowArrivingSecondSaturatesInsteadOfTrapping` covers the
  ordering that actually traps.

**A split verdict is not a refutation** — recorded in `tasks/lessons.md`.

**From a previous pass:** the interactive glass was **measured, not asserted**. A real
mid-press frame was captured (the press blocks the test thread, so the screenshot had to come from
another queue while the finger was still down) and sampled on bands inside the vessel in both the
resting and the scaled-to-0.93 pressed state:

| Region | at rest | pressed | change |
|---|---|---|---|
| glass left of the glyph | 84.6 | **91.3** | **+7.9%** |
| glass right of the glyph | 78.8 | **83.2** | **+5.6%** |
| control — bare backdrop | 86.5 | 86.5 | 0.0% |

The control matters: the aurora is animating, so a number that moved proves nothing until you know
what else moved. The *first* measurement said the button got **darker** — a fixed 120×120 box catches
more dark backdrop once `PressStyle` shrinks the button to 0.93. Recorded in `tasks/lessons.md`.

**From the previous pass:** the language genuinely switches **live**, driven by a
temporary `ZZLanguageProbe` and deleted before staging. In one running process, with no relaunch:
tapping *Русский* replaced `Home · History · Settings` with `Главная · История · Настройки` and
made the English labels *gone* (asserted, not just absent from a screenshot); Home followed, showing
`Стакан, добавить 250 миллилитров`; switching on to *O‘zbekcha* gave `Bosh sahifa`; and *Follow
device* restored English. That last step matters — it proves the picker is a switch and not a
one-way trip.

**Caught by a coverage check, not by a person:** Xcode's build extracts every `Text` / `Label`
literal into the catalogue itself, so the English table is the complete list of what the app can
draw. Comparing it against the Russian table surfaced `Label("Delete", systemImage: "trash")` on the
log's swipe action — no bundle, no translation, and invisible to every other check because it
*looks* fine in English. It is now translated and resolved through the chosen bundle, and
`everyDrawnStringIsTranslatedUnlessDeliberatelyNot` is the guard, with a four-entry allowlist for
the strings that genuinely are not words (`%`, the product name, and two `#Preview` literals).

**Caught before it shipped:** `AppLanguage.english.bundle` resolves `en.lproj`, and a String
Catalogue with `sourceLanguage: en` **emits no `en.lproj`** — the development language lives in the
binary. The resolver would have fallen back to `Bundle.main`, which is not English but *the
device's* language, so choosing English on a Russian phone would have kept drawing Russian. Fixed
by giving every key an explicit `en` value. Written up in `tasks/lessons.md`.

**From the previous pass**, one device, in the five places the suite structurally cannot reach:

- **The three-slot bar renders**, Home stays active with its cyan glow, and
  `testSettingsIsReachableFromHomeAsATab` proves the destination is reachable from *Home* — which
  it was not while Settings was a sheet on the log's header.
- **The aurora genuinely moves, and its resting frame is the old design.** Sampled a 260×260 region
  of backdrop away from the vessel: the static build measured sRGB `(10.8, 96.7, 206.4)`, the
  animated build at rest `(11.2, 96.5, 204.4)`, and seven seconds later `(15.9, 93.0, 175.5)`.
- **Confetti bursts from the vessel** on the crossing tap, and the quick-add row stays `isHittable`
  throughout — so `allowsHitTesting(false)` is doing its job and the celebration cannot eat a tap.
- **The icon is on the Home Screen** and legible at size. `AppIcon.appiconset` held only a
  `Contents.json` before this run, so the app shipped with no icon at all.
- **Russian and Uzbek render**, launched with `-AppleLanguages`: `мл` and
  `Главная · История · Настройки`; `ml` and `Bosh sahifa · Tarix · Sozlamalar`.

Two temporary probes drove the taps — `ZZGoalEditProbe` and `ZZConfettiProbe` — and both were
deleted before staging. `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` is empty.

**One failure worth carrying forward.** The first `LocalizationTests` compared the two
`.xcstrings` files by reading them off disk with `#filePath`. These tests execute on the
**simulator**, and the repo sits under `~/Desktop`, which macOS protects with TCC — so the read
blocked on a privacy prompt no headless run can answer. It did not fail; it **hung the gate**, twice,
until killed. The rewrite asserts the *built bundles* instead, which is both immune to that and
strictly better: it is what caught the `membershipExceptions` failure, where the source files were
perfectly healthy and the widget shipped English anyway.

**From an earlier pass:** the goal editor was driven on the simulator and the result
read from the **App Group container**, not from the UI — one device, `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`,
by a temporary `ZZGoalEditProbe` deleted before staging.

| Step | `dailyGoal` in the shared suite | `ZWATERLOG` | `isGoalSet` |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 2,000 | 9 rows / 3,150 ml | `true` |
| drag the card, release | **2,500** | **9 rows / 3,150 ml** — unchanged | `true` |
| second run, drag again | **3,400**, then **2,500** | unchanged | `true` |

So the commit reaches the container the widget reads, a goal edit logs no water, and editing does
not disturb setup. `GoalCard` renders and stays legible at
`UICTContentSizeCategoryAccessibilityXXXL` — label and figure still share one baseline, the slider
stays full-width and `isHittable`, nothing grows through the card.

Two probe bugs are worth knowing, both recorded in `tasks/lessons.md`, because both are traps this
repo will meet again: an assertion querying an accessibility tree the product **deliberately
closed** (`readoutRow` is `.accessibilityHidden(true)`), which could only ever fail while the
product was correct; and `UICTContentSizeCategoryAccessibilityExtraExtraExtraLarge`, which is not a
category — so the app launched at the default size, every assertion passed, and the screenshot
proved nothing.

**The `isGoalSet` bug below was found by a six-agent rule-compliance review of the diff**, one agent
per rule surface, every candidate then handed to two adversarial verifiers instructed to refute it.
Two candidates, one confirmed, one correctly refuted. The confirmed one survived both refuters and
the failing test written from it reproduced the path exactly.

**From the previous pass:** the portrait restriction was proved, not assumed. With the
device forced to `landscapeLeft`, `XCUIApplication().frame` is still `(0, 0, 393, 852)`, the
*History* tab sits at `(198.7, 764, 144.3, 44)` — on screen, full 44pt — and the tap succeeds.
Before the change the same button reported `{{428, 427.7}, {315, 44}}`, off any portrait screen.
The built bundle carries `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~iphone = [Portrait]` and leaves
`~ipad` at all four.

The iPad run also surfaced a copy bug the phone never showed: `HistoryView`'s empty state still
read *"Tap + on the home screen to log 250 ml"*, naming a button deleted two checkpoints earlier.
It now reads *"Pick a vessel on the Home tab to log your first serving"* and names no amount —
three vessels make naming one of them a different kind of drift. The tab bar also gained a 420pt
width cap, because at 1,120pt wide on an iPad it read as a stretched toolbar rather than a
floating pill.

**From the previous pass:** both tabs were captured from inside the test run —
`simctl` cannot tap, so a temporary probe drove the bar and wrote the screenshots itself. The bar
renders, both destinations swap, `Done` is gone from the log and the gear survives.

**The tab labels' contrast was measured off those pixels, not derived** — the pane is a `Material`
over the aurora and cannot be computed analytically:

| Element | Measured | Floor | |
|---|---|---|---|
| pane itself | sRGB `(0.388, 0.282, 0.484)` | — | |
| active label, white | **7.66:1** | 4.5:1 small text | pass |
| inactive label, white @ 0.72 | **4.89:1** | 4.5:1 small text | pass |
| active glyph, `Aurora.cyan` | **4.34:1** | 3:1 non-text | pass |

The first draft tinted the *label* cyan too, which measured **4.34:1 against a 4.5:1 floor** and
was a real rule `65-accessibility` violation. The glyph keeps the cyan and the glow — an icon is
not text — and the label went white. Nothing but a rendered screenshot would have caught it.

**From the previous pass:** the quick-add row was driven on the simulator and the
result read from the **store**, not from the UI — `tasks/lessons.md` records a session where four
fixes went into a test that was misreading an accessibility value while the product had been
correct every time.

| Step | `ZWATERLOG` | cache `currentWater` |
|---|---|---|
| before | 6 rows, 2,250 ml | — |
| tap Cup, Glass, Bottle once each | **9 rows, 3,150 ml** — three new rows of **150, 250, 500** | **900** |

So each button logs *its own* amount and writes through to the cache the widget reads; the row is
not three copies of one serving. Rendering was checked at the default text size (the row centres,
and all three SF Symbols resolve — a missing one draws nothing at all) and at
`accessibility-extra-extra-extra-large`, where the buttons keep full size and the caption stays
smaller than the glyph it annotates.

**From an earlier pass:** reminders were driven on the simulator, and the pending set
was read from **inside the app's own process** rather than inferred from the UI — the notification
store is `usernotificationsd`'s and is not a readable file, so a probe hosted by the app was the
only ground truth available.

| Step | `UNUserNotificationCenter` pending | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| toggle on, permission granted | **21 requests, all ours** (3 days x 7; today was already past 21:00) | `remindersEnabled = true` |
| toggle off | **0 pending** | `remindersEnabled = false` |

Fire times resolved to the right *local* hour (09:00 shows as 04:00 UTC on this UTC+5 device), and
the copy delivered was value-free. Switching off genuinely clears what is already filed with the
system, which is the failure that would otherwise nag a user for days.

Earlier passes also verified the SwiftData store and cache agreeing after edits and deletes, and
both roots rendering at accessibility text sizes.

**Still not verified:**

- **Whether a widget extension may reach the notification service at runtime.** This is the one
  thing research could not settle: the *addressing* is proven (an `.appex` resolves through
  `LSPlugInKitProxy.containingBundle`, so its requests land in the app's pending set — established
  by disassembling the shipping framework), but the sandbox permission is not, and kernel sandbox
  profiles cannot be read. Apple denies this same call to Background Assets extensions.
  `AddWaterIntent` attempts it, and `DataManager.refresh()` reconciles on every foreground as the
  backstop, so a denial degrades to "reminders correct themselves next time you open the app"
  rather than to broken. **Placing the widget and tapping it is the test that would close this.**
- **The widget on a Home Screen** — the longstanding gap, and **it now covers more than it did**.
  Since the quick-add vessels became editable, the widget's button face and the amount it logs both
  come from `entry.snapshot.serving` rather than a compiled-in constant.
  `theWidgetsServingIsTheAppsMiddleVessel` proves the value crosses the process boundary; only a
  Home Screen proves it *draws*, and only a tap proves it logs the edited amount rather than 250.
  The route: run the **app** scheme, launch once, add *Hydration* from the gallery, then edit the
  middle vessel in Settings and watch the face. A tinted (templated) configuration is unseen too.
- **The midnight language fix, end to end.** `rolledOver()` is unit-tested and the old bug is
  understood, but nobody has watched a real widget cross local midnight and keep its language.
- **Reduce Transparency on `HistoryView`/`SettingsView`** — `simctl ui reduce_transparency` is not a
  supported option on this Xcode, so the path has not been seen.
- **Goal-met silencing, on device.** Covered by `ReminderPlanTests` and `ReminderSeamTests`, but the
  device run happened after 21:00 when today was empty anyway, so it was not independently exercised.

### Git

**There is no git repository.** Verified this pass:

```
$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
$ ls -a            # no .git, and no .gitignore either
```

Every previous edition of this section described `HEAD = 2095ff0` *Initial Commit* on `main`, with
**83 paths staged** and a self-consistent index, and enumerated their composition. **None of that
is true of this tree.** Nothing here is under version control, so nothing is staged, nothing is
committed, and there is no history to recover a bad change from.

Whether to initialise one is the owner's call — rule `90-git` says so explicitly, and that rule's
first line ("This project is not a git repository yet") is the one claim about version control in
this repo that has stayed accurate. When it happens, `.gitignore` needs `build/`, `DerivedData/`,
`**/xcuserdata/`, `.DS_Store` and `.claude/settings.local.json`, and must **not** ignore
`xcshareddata/`.

This is recorded as known issue #13 rather than quietly corrected, because a doc that described a
staged, buildable index for several passes is a doc that was being *written from the plan rather
than from the tree* — which is the failure this document's own opening line warns about.

## Known issues / tech debt

*Resolved the same day and kept out of this list: the stale index entries and the template test
stub (second `HISTORY.md` checkpoint); the partial staging; and the stale "no `ModelContainer`"
claims in `CLAUDE.md` and six rule files, which were corrected once the owner authorised editing
`.claude/`.*

*Also resolved: `WaterLog`'s CRUD was built and unused (`HistoryView` is now its consumer), and the
app had no settings surface at all (`SettingsView` is now it).*

*Resolved on 2026-08-29: **the iPhone landscape gap.** The app carried the Xcode template's
`LandscapeLeft`/`LandscapeRight` on iPhone, where a 393pt-tall canvas cannot hold a 280pt vessel
and the tab bar fell off-screen. `INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPhone` is now
`UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait` in both configurations. **iPad is deliberately left at all four**
— verified on an iPad Pro 11-inch, where the app is 1,210 x 834 in landscape, the vessel sits at
`(465, 156, 280, 280)` and the tab bar at `(607, 755, 553, 44)`: entirely on screen and reachable.
Restricting the iPad would also require `UIRequiresFullScreen`, which would disable Split View —
a much larger decision than this one, and unnecessary since nothing there is broken.*

*Resolved on 2026-08-29: **the goal is editable after setup**, which was #1 and the largest product
gap on this list. `SettingsView` gained `GoalCard` — the same 1,000–4,000 range setup offers, read
from `GoalSetupView.goalRange` rather than re-declared, committing on drag-end so one gesture is one
write, one widget reload and one reminder re-plan. #2 went with it: the setup copy now says "You can
change this later in Settings", a line deliberately withheld while it would have been a lie.*

*That change also closed a defect it had itself created, found by an adversarial review of the diff
and fixed before staging: `saveDailyGoal(ml:)`'s `guard !storedIsGoalSet else { return }` skipped
the **only** write of `Key.isGoalSet` in the product. Harmless while `GoalSetupView` was the sole
caller — it is presented only while the flag is `false`, so the guard could never short-circuit —
and reachable the moment `GoalCard` became the second. On the upgrade path the flag is inferred and
never stored, so editing such a goal down to exactly `defaultDailyGoal` left nothing on disk, and
the next read re-derived `false` and cross-faded the whole app back into setup mid-session.
Persistence is now guarded on the key and observation on the in-memory flag. See `docs/STATE.md`
and `editingAnInferredGoalDownToTheDefaultPersistsTheFlag`.*

1. **`AddWaterIntent`'s Shortcuts vocabulary is untranslated.** Found by the `/doc_sync` pass on
   2026-08-29 and deliberately not fixed there, because that command may not touch source. Five
   strings — `Log Water`, its `IntentDescription`, `Amount`, `Millilitres of water to log.` and
   `Log ${amount} ml of water` — carry no `ru` or `uz`, so a Russian or Uzbek user who adds the
   WaterBuddy action in Shortcuts gets an English one while the widget beside it draws their
   language. They are `LocalizedStringResource` and `@Parameter` macro arguments and therefore
   **compile-time constants**, so honouring the in-app picker may be impossible; following the
   *device* language is almost certainly just a matter of translating the keys.
   `everyDrawnStringIsTranslatedUnlessDeliberatelyNot` missed it because it checks the app bundle
   and not the extension's — extending it is the first half of the fix. Detail in `docs/WIDGET.md`.
   *(Also noticed: three dead keys in the widget catalogue — `+%lld`, `1,450 ml`, `Today` — extracted
   before the interpolated `Text` sites became `String(format:)` and no longer produced by any
   source. Noise, not a bug.)*

2. **Reminders are `.active`, so iOS may batch them.** `.timeSensitive` would break through a
   Notification Summary and needs the `com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive`
   entitlement — rule `70-privacy` forbids adding a capability to improve something, so the cost is
   stated in `SettingsView` instead of hidden. Revisit only as a deliberate capability decision.
3. **The reminder has no action button.** Tapping it just opens the app. A "Log 250 ml" action would
   fit the product's arc exactly, but it needs a `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, which can only
   be set from the app and requires an `NSObject` conformer this codebase does not have. Its own
   change.
4. **`allLogs()` is still unused — and history shipped without it.** Verified this pass: the only
   remaining mention under `WaterBuddy/` is inside a DocC comment. The week card takes a *bounded*
   window through `readLogs(from:to:)` instead, deliberately — `allLogs()` passes no predicate, no
   `fetchLimit` and no `fetchOffset`, so it materialises every row fully faulted onto the main
   actor, and a naive per-day grouping would redo that on every screen appearance. At roughly
   1,500–3,700 rows a year the absolute cost is small; the hazard is that an in-memory test store
   with a handful of rows can never see it. Either give it a caller that genuinely wants
   everything, or delete it.
5. **The simulator's App Group holds test data** from this session's verification runs. The device was `simctl erase`d partway through to get a clean goal crossing, so the current contents are whatever the confetti probe logged — eight bottles against a 4,000 ml goal —
   the earlier six including a synthetic 1,000 ml serving, plus the 150/250/500 this run tapped in. Harmless, and only on the simulator; `simctl erase`
   clears it if a clean first-run state is wanted.
6. ~~**Six of the eight `DataManager(` sites in the test target omit `rescheduleReminders:`, so they
   drive the real notification centre.**~~ **Fixed 2026-08-31.** The six named were the right six —
   `WaterLogTests.swift:51, :265, :291, :293, :416` and `HistoryViewTests.swift:44` — but the
   **denominator was two changes stale**: re-derived from the tree there are **eleven** construction
   sites, not eight, because `ServingSeamTests` and `HistoryRangeTests` each added correct ones after
   this entry was last counted. Lesson recorded — a known issue's numbers rot like any other doc's.

   Not fixed as "one line per site". `WaterLogTests` held five of the six, and five construction
   sites in one file are five templates for the next copy — which is exactly how
   `tasks/lessons.md` records this trap spreading. One file-level
   `makeManager(defaults:container:now:onReload:onReschedule:)`, in the shape `DataManagerTests` and
   `ServingSeamTests` already use, now serves all five paths; `HistoryViewTests`' single site was
   wired in place. **The test target went from 11 construction sites to 7, and all 7 pass every
   argument** (re-verified this pass by script, not by eye).

   The guard is a pair of tests, because the two obvious guards are both forbidden here: a test may
   not read the source tree to count call sites (under TCC that *hangs the gate*, not fails it), and
   may not construct a real centre to inspect what was removed. What is observable is the seam
   firing, so `theStoreFixtureRoutesTheReminderPlanToTheInjectedSeam` and
   `theServingEditorFixtureRoutesTheReminderPlanToTheInjectedSeam` hand each fixture a spy and assert
   it was called. `DataManagerTests` turned out to have been guarded this way all along without
   anyone naming it — `togglingRemindersRePlansImmediately` fails on the same condition, which is why
   that file's fixture never rotted.

   **The same defect is still live in the app target**, and was deliberately left there: the
   `#Preview`s in `HomeView.swift:381`, `GoalSetupView.swift:267` and `HistoryView.swift:640` omit
   the argument, as rule `50-views` records. (`SettingsView` and `RootTabView` inject it, with
   comments.) Rule `90-git` defers a known one-line fix in an unrelated file to its own change — so
   this is now known issue #14 below.
7. **Three files under `.claude/` still describe the `+` button the quick-add row replaced** —
   `CLAUDE.md:135`, `.claude/rules/65-accessibility.md:33` and `.claude/rules/50-views.md:67`.
   Every underlying rule still holds; only the worked example is stale. Left untouched because
   rule `99-docs-cascade` says `.claude/` is not derived — it changes when the owner decides.
8. ~~**No shared schemes are checked in.**~~ **Retired 2026-09-01 — they now are.**
   `WaterBuddy.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/` holds both `WaterBuddy.xcscheme` and
   `WaterBuddyWidgetExtension.xcscheme` (written 2026-08-31 23:48). This makes rule `90-git`'s
   *"Do not ignore `xcshareddata/`"* load-bearing rather than hypothetical: the schemes are now
   real files that a `.gitignore` could swallow, and the gate commands stop being reproducible if
   it does.
9. ~~**The gate command written into `CLAUDE.md` and rule `85-testing` no longer resolves.**~~
   **Retired 2026-09-01 — it resolves.** Re-probed by running a test rather than by asking:
   `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.6,name=iPhone 16'` with
   `-only-testing:WaterBuddyTests/AppTabTests` returns `✔ Test run with 6 tests in 1 suite passed`.
   The documented commands are correct as written and the `id=` workaround should be dropped —
   rule `85-testing` forbids pinning by device id because it resolves on nobody else's machine.
   **Note the `OS=18.6` is now doing more work than before:** two iOS runtimes are installed (18.6
   and 26.5), so an unpinned or `OS=latest` destination is ambiguous.

   *Why the earlier failure was real and is now gone is not established.* The likeliest reading is
   that installing the iOS 26.5 runtime rebuilt the device list. Recorded rather than explained.
10. ~~**`waterBuddyKeys(in:)` enumerates six of the seven keys.**~~ **Fixed 2026-08-30**, as the
   prerequisite it was called out as being: the helper now reduces over `DataManager.Key.all`, and
   the roster lives beside the declarations it mirrors. The eighth key landed after that, not before.

   **Correction, 2026-09-01: this entry's last clause was wrong.** It said
   `theTripwireHelperEnumeratesEveryStoredKey` "fails the moment the two disagree". It cannot —
   `waterBuddyKeys(in:)` **is** `Key.all.reduce(…)`, so the assertion is `Set(Key.all) ==
   Set(Key.all)` and holds for every possible content of the roster. That test's own DocC
   (`WaterSnapshotTests.swift:217-228`) now says so at length and explains why it is kept anyway:
   it pins that the helper is *exactly* the roster and no wider, so nobody reinstates the
   hand-written list it replaced. The guarantee this entry claimed lives in
   `DataManagerTests.everyKeyTheProductWritesIsOnTheRoster` (`:125`), which drives the real writers,
   reads the suite back, and carries an anti-vacuity floor.
11. **The DocC on `refreshRepublishesLogsWrittenByAnotherInstance` describes code that is not
   there.** `WaterLogTests.swift:404` says it "Pins the `recomputeToday()` in
   ``DataManager/refresh()``" and reasons about "the re-derive". `refresh()` calls
   `loadFromStore()` → `resetIfNeeded()` → `republishTodaysLogs()` → `republishHistory()` →
   `rescheduleRemindersNow()`, and **not** `recomputeToday()` — while `republishTodaysLogs()`' own
   DocC records that making `refresh()` recompute was *tried and rejected* because it destroys
   water. The test is green for a different reason than its comment gives (`loadFromStore()` picks
   the cached total back up). DocC outranks the rule files in this repo, so a comment describing a
   rejected design is actively misleading.
12. **This document claimed `GoalSetupUITests` pins orientation in `setUp`. It does not.** There is
   no `XCUIDevice` reference anywhere under `WaterBuddyUITests/`, although `tasks/lessons.md`
   records adding one after a landscape-state flake. The claim is corrected above; the mitigation
   itself was never applied. Lower risk than it was, since the iPhone is portrait-only now, but the
   suite still depends on how a simulator was last left.
13. **There is no git repository.** `git rev-parse HEAD` returns *fatal: not a git repository*, and
   there is no `.git` directory. Earlier editions of this document described `HEAD = 2095ff0` with
   83 staged paths and a self-consistent index; none of that is true of this tree, and nothing here
   is under version control. Initialising one is the owner's call (rule `90-git`).

14. **The three `#Preview`s that reconcile against a real notification centre.** `HomeView.swift:381`,
   `GoalSetupView.swift:267` and `HistoryView.swift:640` construct a `DataManager` without
   `rescheduleReminders:`, so every canvas rebuild reaches
   `DataManager.requestReminderReschedule` and can remove real pending requests under
   `ReminderPlan.identifierPrefix`. Named by rule `50-views` and by `tasks/lessons.md`, which
   records the same trap surviving in two previews once before. `SettingsView.swift:640` and
   `RootTabView.swift:235` already inject it and carry the comment explaining why. Split out of
   known issue #6 on 2026-08-31 rather than folded into it: the test-target fix is one logical
   change and rule `90-git` keeps an unrelated one-line fix out of it. One line per site, and
   unlike the test target there is no tripwire available — a `#Preview` is not executed by the gate.

15. **Two rule files mandate a guard the code no longer has.** `.claude/rules/40-widget.md:77` and
   `.claude/rules/80-notifications.md:101` both say *"`DataManager.requestReminderReschedule` keeps
   its `guard !isAppExtension else { return }`"*. It reads `guard role.mayFileReminders else
   { return }`, and a tree-wide grep for `!Self.isAppExtension` returns **zero**. A third file,
   `43-concurrency.md:75`, names the function without quoting the guard and is still accurate.
   Rule `99-docs-cascade` puts `.claude/` outside what a doc sync may correct, so this is the
   owner's call — but it is wrong *today*, and it is the kind of stale worked example that gets
   copied into the next change.

16. **Three DocC comments in `DataManager.swift` were left stale by the role model.** Identified
   2026-09-01; **not fixed — the edit was declined when attempted**, and rule `00-workspace` makes
   a refused tool call a stop sign rather than something to route around.
   - `:614` — *"Guarded on `isAppExtension`"*, above a body that reads `Self.role.drawsHistory`.
     This is known issue #11's exact shape: DocC outranks the rule files here, so a comment naming
     a symbol the code no longer uses actively misdirects.
   - `:842` — *"Returns immediately in an extension"*, at the `mayFileReminders` site. Now also
     true of a watch, which is the entire point of the role model.
   - `:620` — *"none of the seven cache keys"*; `Key.all` holds **eight**. Pre-existing since the
     `servings` key, not caused by the role model.

17. **The role model is half-built by its own design's account.** `DataManager.role` answers at
   *runtime*; the `@available(watchOS, unavailable)` markers that would make the six guard sites
   unreachable by *compilation* are not in the tree (`grep -c '@available' DataManager.swift` → 0).
   That is deliberate sequencing, not an oversight — see
   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-waterbuddy-watchos-design.md` §3.2 and step 3′ — but until it
   lands, nothing stops a future watch target from constructing a `DataManager`.

## Where the rest is written down

- `docs/STATE.md` — the stored shape: keys, types, clamps, the rollover, the migration, the reminder seam
- `.claude/rules/80-notifications.md` — the notification rulings: why the plan is pure, why `add`
  replaces and `remove` cannot be awaited, why the widget shares the app's pending set
- `docs/WIDGET.md` — the widget contract: families, timeline, rendering modes, intent parameters
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — the design tokens and the measurements behind them
- `tasks/lessons.md` — pitfalls learned, append-only
- `HISTORY.md` — checkpoints, append-only

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` and `docs/dependencies.md` do **not** exist. The
topology is fully carried by `.claude/rules/10-architecture.md`, the capability surface by
`25-shared-storage` + `15-project`, and there are no dependencies to record. A stub restating a
rule file reads as coverage and is worse than the file's absence.
